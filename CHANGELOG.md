### Changed
- [Commit 0392ca7a7e7049f63bf71bf0b2369d06f1194149](https://github.com/mancku/strapi-plugin-schemas-to-ts/commit/0392ca7a7e7049f63bf71bf0b2369d06f1194149)

  - Converting to pascal case after replacing invalid chars would result in losing the underscore in snake case values, so the pascal case would not work properly. Modifying the order would first properly  convert to pascal case and then remove the remaining unwanted chars.
